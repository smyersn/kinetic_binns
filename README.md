Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been adopted by biologists for 
learning dynamics from experimental data. Here, I am using a PINN to 
approximate reaction diffusion equations as a surface from simulated data. 
Then, I am using a genetic algorithm to fit biologically interpretable rate 
laws to the surface. Eventually, this work will be extended to learn reaction-
diffusion equations from experimental data.
